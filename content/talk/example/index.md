abstract: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) in current application has limited payload and endurance. Multiple USV’s are often used to overcome these limitations but, path planning of multiple USV’s mostly uses either leader – follower approach or formation fleet which leads to a myopic optimization problem. Only the leader vehicle have the ability to make an independent decision. To avoid this problem, USV’s in this study will be considered as mobile agents where each USV can make a decision independently and will maintain communication with other members of the team.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
