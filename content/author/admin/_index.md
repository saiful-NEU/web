Md Saiful Islam is a graduate student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University. His researches interest includes Machine Learning, Data Mining, Robust Causal Inference and their application in optimal decision making in healthcare. Currently, he is developing machine learning based techniques to identify causal links in a big data which is robust to the choice of the experimenter. His previous works encompass efficient service delivery, and waste reduction in healthcare, resilient supply chain design, and shortest path problems for unmanned vehicles.
